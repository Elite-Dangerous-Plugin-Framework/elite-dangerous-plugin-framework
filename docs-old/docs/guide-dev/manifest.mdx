# The Manifest File

Each plugin _must_ define a `manifest.json` file. If it's missing, the plugin is not recognized as such.

Here is a TypeScript Interface Definition for the Manifest:

```ts
type PluginManifest = PluginManifestV1Alpha; // to be expanded later

type PluginManifestV1Alpha = {
  /// This is "constant" - tells us we have a v1alpha-spec'd Manifest
  type: "v1alpha";
  /// What is this plugin's name? This name shouldn't change over time as
  /// the internal ID and plugin-stored settings are tied to it.
  /// The internal name is derived from this name by replacing spaces with
  /// dashes and removing any unsafe characters and making the remaining
  /// characters lowercase.
  name: string;
  /// A short description about what this Plugin is doing.
  description?: string | undefined;
  /// optionally, a URL to the Git Repository
  repository_url?: string | undefined;
  /// optionally, a link where the user can get support. Can be a Discord
  /// Link, Github Issues, etc.
  support_url?: string | undefined;
  /// each plugin has a default set of permissions like getting the current
  /// full journal, getting the Status.json, Backpack.json, etc. + anything
  /// a browser could do some plugins might need additional permissions,
  /// e.g. File Read Access / Write Access
  permissions?: PluginPermission[] | undefined;
  /// Put a semantic version here (e.g. `0.0.1`). If missing, the version
  /// `0.0.0-dev` is assumed.
  version?: string | undefined;
  /// A list of versions. This is ignored from the local file and only the
  /// remote manifest is considered.
  versions?: PluginVersionOption[];
  /// This contains the strategy the plugin should take during updating to
  /// find out if there is a new update. If missing, will not attempt to update.
  remote_manifest?: PluginRemoteManifestResolutionStrategy | undefined;
};
```

This means that a minimal plugin manifest would look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "v1alpha",
  "name": "My Super Awesome Plugin"
  // derived internal id: my-super-awesome-plugin
}
```
