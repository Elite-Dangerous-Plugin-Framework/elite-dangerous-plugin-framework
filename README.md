# Roadmap

## Minimum Viable Product v0.1.X

This will be the initial release, containing the neccesary logic to load plugins, start / stop plugins, display and arrange plugins.

This will _NOT_ contain a plugin registry.

Things at this stage are not stable, APIs may change.

You can track the remainder of this initial release in [the following project](https://github.com/orgs/Elite-Dangerous-Plugin-Framework/projects/1).

## The registry update v0.2.X

To be refined
