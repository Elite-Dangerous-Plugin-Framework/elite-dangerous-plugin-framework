# Getting Started

EDPF is a tool available on Windows and Linux which runs in the background while you are playing the game. You can select from a range of EDPF-provided (official) and 3rd party plugins. These plugins receive updates about the game from the game's journal and can action based on that.

EDPF is *heavily* inspired by [Elite: Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) (EDMC). See more under [Motivation](./motivation.md).

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available for both Windows and Linux for x86 Architectures. Other Architectures are not supported.

### Build from Source

You are also free to build EDPF on your own.  
You will need the requirements as [defined by Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/), as well as the [Rust toolchain](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#rust).
