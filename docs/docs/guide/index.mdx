# Getting Started

EDPF is a tool available on Windows and Linux which runs in the background while you are playing the game. You can select from a range of EDPF-provided (official) and 3rd party plugins. These plugins receive updates about the game from the game's journal and can action based on that.

EDPF is *heavily* inspired by [Elite: Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) (EDMC). See more under [Motivation](./motivation.md).
