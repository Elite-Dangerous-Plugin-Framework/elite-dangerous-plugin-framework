# Elite Dangerous Journal Schemas

This module contains autogenerated Type definitions for the Elite: Dangerous Journal.
This uses https://jixxed.github.io/ed-journal-schemas/ as its source of Schemas.

Besides the Type definitions, this module contains 2 helper functions which will parse the Journal Entry with either BigInts or regular IEEE 754 64-bit floats for integers.
